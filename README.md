# AlgoRhythm: A Collection of LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to **AlgoRhythm**, a curated repository of coding challenges and solutions primarily sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). This repository is designed as a comprehensive resource for programmers at various levels aiming to improve their coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and understand complex algorithms through practical examples.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains a collection of solved problems from LeetCode. Each problem is organized in its dedicated folder named according to the convention `001_title-of-problem`, where `001` is the problem number and `title-of-problem` is a kebab-case version of the problem title. This naming scheme makes it easy to find and reference problems.

### Naming Convention

- **Folders**: Each folder is named as `NNN_title-of-problem` where `NNN` is the problem number with leading zeros and `title-of-problem` is the problem's title in lower case separated by hyphens.
- **Files**: Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` and solution code files relevant to the problem.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigating Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a specific problem on LeetCode, named for quick reference.
2. **Understanding Solutions**: Each folder contains:
   - A `README.md` with a comprehensive explanation of the problem and solution.
   - Source code files in various programming languages as needed.
3. **Running Code**: Source code files are placed within the same folder as their respective problem. You can run these files in your local development environment or any online compiler compatible with the language.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors are encouraged to add new solutions, refine existing ones, or provide translations to other programming languages. If you wish to contribute:
- **Fork** the repository.
- Add or update solutions in a **new branch**.
- Submit a **pull request** with a clear list of what you have done.
- Your contributions will be reviewed and, if deemed beneficial, merged into the main branch.

## README Template for Problems

Each problem folder includes a `README.md` following a specific template. You can find this template [here](./README_TEMPLATE.md).

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to all contributors, although we are just starting and looking forward to our first official contributors. We are also thankful to the submitters and educators on LeetCode and YouTube, whose examples and explanations have been invaluable in enhancing our understanding and solutions.
